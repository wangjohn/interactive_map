===============

Project for creating an interactive map

TODO:
- Dropdown menu to make orange things
- Start off with all of the events plotted
- If the dot is clicked, then progress bar "pauses" and a dialogue box expands to the left (pushing the two icons along with it). The dialogue box will list information about that specific event: Venue Name, Date, city and state, # of people killed, # of people injured
